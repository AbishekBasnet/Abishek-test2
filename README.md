# Abishek-test2
I developed a React project featuring reusable Navbar and Footer components. The Navbar displays my name on the left and includes a responsive hamburger menu, built with AI assistance, that provides navigation to Home, Hero Section, and Three Column pages, with smooth transition effects. Both the Hero Section and Three Column pages are implemented separately: the Hero Section showcases an image of Mount Everest along with two buttons, Get Started and Learn More, while the Three Column page highlights images of Pokhara, Kathmandu, and Lumbini. The Footer component displays copyright information, and both the Navbar and Footer are consistently visible across the Home, Hero Section, and Three Column pages. I leveraged GitHub Copilot to accelerate the development process and enhance productivity.
